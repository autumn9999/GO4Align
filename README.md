Welcome to the official repository for "GO4Align: Group Optimization for Multi-Task Alignment," one effective and efficient approach to multi-task optimization. 

**Project Webpage:** Details will be available soon.

## Abstract

This paper proposes GO4Align, a multi-task optimization approach that tackles task imbalance by explicitly aligning the optimization across tasks. 
To achieve this, we design an adaptive group risk minimization strategy, compromising two crucial techniques in implementation:
- **dynamical group assignment**, which clusters similar tasks based on task interactions; 
- **risk-guided group indicators**, which exploit consistent task correlations with risk information from previous iterations. 

Comprehensive experimental results on diverse typical benchmarks demonstrate our method's performance superiority with even lower computational costs.

## Paper
The preprint of our paper will soon be available on arXiv. Stay tuned for the link.

## Code
We are currently preparing our codebase for public release. Keep an eye on this repository for updates and additional resources, including detailed documentation and implementation guides.
